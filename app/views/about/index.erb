    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <h3>We are a committed group of Americans</h3>
    <p>
    who believe the American Dream is for everyone who lives in our country. We all benefit each day a family in America gets closer to their Dream.
    </p>
    <h3>We believe in the resilience of all American communities.</h3>
  <p> However, not all have access to critical support structures. Our most vulnerable communities are strengthened by both governmental and private support; these help build a foundation to attain the American Dream for their families.
  </p>
    <h3>We believe that some of America’s most vulnerable communities are likely to become increasingly marginalized</h3>
    <p>over the next four years, while many of us in more secure circumstances reap a windfall from the President-Elect’s proposed tax cuts (based on the President- Elect’s campaign promises to date). Supporting the resilience of these communities is the focus of our effort.
    </p>
    <h3>We believe the economic growth impact of tax cuts on the highest earning Americans is unproven.</h3>
    <p>Though there might be a short-term increase in consumption and investment, evidence suggests the tax cuts proposed by President-Elect Trump will likely increase income equality and increase our federal deficit over the long-term. When combined with the stated policy agenda of the President-Elect and America’s experience over the past 40 years, these tax cuts will likely result in cuts to services for politically underrepresented and vulnerable communities.
    </p>
    <h3>We believe collective action will galvanize support for these communities at a time when they need it most</h3>
    <p>and the #<hashpledge> will offer an avenue for all who pay American taxes to direct their resources and energies to the communities and causes they care most about.</p>
    <h3>We believe America has been built on a strong tradition of social investment and activism.</h3>
    <p>The moment is now to enlist and energize new investors in these important causes for these important communities.</p>
